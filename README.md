# Udemy-Spark-Python

Learning from the https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-for-java-developers
The course is for Java, because I thought I would use Java at the time I bought it.

Since then, it seems it would be better to use Python for various reasons.
So this project is basically my solutions in Python to the exercises of this Java course...
But hey, Spark is still Spark, isn't it ?
